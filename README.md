# webscrapers
A collection of webscrapers I've made for various things.

<strong>4chan_media_scraper.py:</strong>
Downloads any media files from the designated board on 4chan. Was mainly used as a tool for learning website APIs with webscraping.

<strong>abcnew_scraper.py:</strong>
Crawls through https://www.abc.net.au/news/ and pulls the headlines of articles with their dates and links then writes them to a csv file. Was used as a learning tool for both webscraping specific targets and writing to csv files.
